# unit-testing-using-dotnet-test
Adapting to Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu 22.04
Pros:
- delighted with my progress into programming from developing; a Coder apart from the noisy MSAD crowd
- same IDE used by all testing hiring doing on code test interview phase 
firms
Cons:
- slow comapred to using Visual Studio proper in Windows, or even Linqpad 7
- learning to do familiars anew erodes RAED advantage of a Visual Studio veteran
